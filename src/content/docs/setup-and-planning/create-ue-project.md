As a starting point for File Explorer Simulator, the VR Template project in Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) is a good choice. This guide will walk you through the steps to create a new project using this template.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Unreal Engine 5 installed on your system. You can download it from the [Epic Games Launcher](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download).
- Familiarize yourself with the Unreal Engine interface and basic concepts, such as projects, assets, and levels.

## Steps to Create a New Project

1. **Open Unreal Engine 5**: Launch the Epic Games Launcher and click on the "Unreal Engine" tab. Then, click on the "Launch" button for UE5.
2. **Create a New Project**: In the Unreal Engine 5 project browser, click on the "New Project" tab.
3. **Select the VR Template**: In the project templates section, scroll down to find the "Virtual Reality" category. Click on the "VR Template" option.
4. **Configure Project Settings**:
   - **Project Name**: Enter a name for your project (e.g., "FileExplorerSim").
   - **Project Location**: Choose a directory where you want to save the project.
   - **Starter Content**: You can choose to include starter content if you like. I have checked this option.
5. **Create the Project**: Click on the "Create" button to generate your new project. UE5 will take a moment to set up the project files and open the editor.

Great! You now have a new Unreal Engine 5 project based on the VR Template. You can start customizing it to fit your needs.
