This website is built using [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/), a documentation theme for [Astro](https://astro.build/). It is designed to help you get started with writing documentation.

## Adding a new page

To add a new page to your documentation, create a new Markdown file in the `src/content/docs` directory. For example, to create a new page called "My New Page", create a file called `my-new-page.md` in the `src/content/docs` directory.

```markdown
---
title: My New Page
description: A description of my new page.
---

This is my new page.
```
